<p>Network of 1218 stations throughout the US. This does not mean that there is a continuous record of data from all the stations, that all stations are still active, or that all stations began taking data at the same time.</p>
<p>Data ranged (at the time I looked at it) from 1849-2009.</p>
<p>There are serious questions regarding the quality of the stations and the data they produce. These are summed up in <a href="surfacestationsreport_spring09.pdf">this</a> report from <a href="http://www.surfacestations.org/">SurfaceStations.org</a>, which found endemic inconsistencies in station placement and maintenance. Changes in the paint on the stations, placement of electronics within the enclosure, placement of the station too close to buildings, heat sources, or parking lots were all cited as problems with the stations. With 70% (865 of 1221) of the network surveyed, only 11% of the stations were considered to be of quality. A map of station quality follows.</p>

<p>Quality ratings and definitions were taken from the USCRN Network's <a href="http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/uscrn/documentation/program/X030FullDocumentD0.pdf">Site Information Handbook</a>. <a href="http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2/monthly/menne-etal2009.pdf">Menne et al 2009</a> states that "the collective effect of changes in observation practice at USHCN stations is of the same order of magnitude as the background climate signal". <a href="http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2/monthly/menne-etal2010.pdf">Menne et al 2010</a> states that "the adjusted USHCN temperatures are extremely well aligned with recent measurements from instruments whose exposure characteristics meet the highest standards for climate monitoring. In summary, we find no evidence that the CONUS average temperature trends are inflated due to poor station siting."</p>
<p>Additionally, changes to the data are not always well-documented and the source code for adjusting the data is not publically available [Note: A <a href="http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2/monthly/software/">software directory</a> became available 19th February 2010]. Some discussion of the USHCN's by GISS can be found <a href="http://climateaudit.org/2007/08/11/does-hansens-error-matter/">here</a>, at Steve McIntyre's blog.</p>
<p>Reports have been published countering the above and indicating that the record is still an accurate representation of climate.</p>
<p>There may somewhere be a document detailing each station's history, but I'm not sure where this may be. (Todo)</p>

<p>Data availability varied over time. If we consider the percentage of points available in a given year versus the number of points which would have been available if the full network including all historically-available was online, the following graphs (which originate from <a href="ushcn_daily_data_quality.c">this</a> code) result.</p>


<hr>
<p>Data for this project was drawn from the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN): a group of approximately 1200 stations, 33 in Minnesota, spread across the 48 contiguous states, drawn from the U.S. Cooperative Observer Network. The USHCN was developed as a collaboration between NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and the Department of Energy's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC). The stations produce a set of daily values for maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth.</p>

<p>While proof-of-concept models for the project utilised a different data set&mdash;the USHCN version 2 Monthly Data, discussed below&mdash;it was intended that this be replaced with daily data during actual analysis. Daily data is desirable because it records often important discrete extremes which are averaged out in the monthly data sets. For instance, while a given January may average -20F, certain species of tree-preying beetles are only killed if the temperature drops below -40F, something which is impossible to see in averaged data.</p>

<p>However, data auditing showed trade-offs between the amount of data available and the reliability of the method of analysis used by this project. Our climate tracking paradigm relies on fitting quadratic surfaces to temporally-varying data and the assumption that temporal changes in the fitted quadratics correspond only to changes in climate. The chart below of the percentage of bad or missing data points over time shows this assumption to be invalid: missing data is also a source of variation. Significantly less USHCN data is available at the beginning of the record than at the end; disturbingly, the last decade shows the first long-term decrease in data availability, denying future scientists access to consistent high spatial resolution data.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="mn_summary_chart.png"></div>
<p>Minnesota is reflective of the United States as a whole:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="us_summary_chart.png"></div>

<p>While it may be possible to ignore the beginning of the record where whole months or years worth of data are missing (some stations had not even been put into operation yet), the entire record is littered with missing days. Throughout the period from 1950-2009, which shows the highest data availability above, very few stations show complete records, as illustrated below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="ushcn_daily_quality_count_mn.png"></p>
<p>The trend is similar for the United States as a whole:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="ushcn_daily_quality_count.png"></p>

<p>For many stations, there is at least one month, and possibly many more, for which days of data are missing. A snapshot of the data availability from 1900 onwards for the entire network is below (white is 100% data availability, green is 0% data availability, blue is intermediate):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="ushcn_daily_month_picture_us_tmax.png"></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="ushcn_daily_month_picture_us_prcp.png"></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="ushcn_daily_month_picture_mn_tmax.png"></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="ushcn_daily_month_picture_mn_prcp.png"></p>

<p>It is clear from the above, that there is no subset of stations within the USHCN for which long-term climate data is available without any missing values.</p>

<p>This implies that any project seeking to work with the USHCN must have a methodology for handling instances of missing data.</p>

<p>Perhaps missing data can simply be ignored?

<h2>USCRN (High-quality, but not yet useful)</h2>
<p>The US Climate Reference Network (<a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/crn/">USCRN</a>) consists of 114 NOAA-maintained stations.</p>
<p>The site states:</p>
<blockquote>
One of the principal conclusions of the 1997 Conference on the World Climate Research Programme was that the global capacity to observe the Earth's climate system is inadequate and deteriorating worldwide and "without action to reverse this decline and develop the GCOS, the ability to characterize climate change and variations over the next 25 years will be even less than during the past quarter century" ( National Research Council [NRC] 1999). In spite of the United States being a leader in climate research, we do not have, in fact, an observing network capable of ensuring long-term climate records free of time-dependent biases. Even small biases can alter the interpretation of decadal climate variability and change.
</blockquote>
<p>Another quote:</p>
<blockquote>
Over the last decade, the amount of money in our economy that is directly impacted by the reliability of NOAAâ€™s climate data has increased dramatically. Errors in the data which might not have mattered a decade ago can now cost individuals and corporations millions of dollars. With our existing network, these errors are guaranteed to occur. However, the Climate Reference Network would be able to provide these sectors of the economy with reliable data
</blockquote>
<p>Performance of the system is measured against 4000 US Coop stations (todo: where do we get this data?) to see how they correlate. It is unclear to me (todo) what value might be derived from this statistic since the point of the USCRN is to be a higher-quality observation network than the US Coop.</p>
<p>Since the network had only 2 stations in 2000 (and ~203 by 2011), the data set is probably not yet useful for this study.</p>
<hr>
<h2>USHCN-M (High-quality, but not yet useful)</h2>
<p>U.S. Historical Climatology Network - Modernization (USHCN-M) will maintain the same quality as the USCRN, but be spaced more closely, and focus solely on temperature and precipitation. The USHCN-M stations will be deployed at a 100km spatial resolution to provide for the detection of regional climate change signals. Following completion of the pilot project, the long-term vision is deployment in each of the nine NOAA climate regions of the United States at a 100 km spatial resolution that will allow the detection of regional climate change signals. About 1000 locations in the United States will have either a USHCN-M or USCRN station at the end of deployment for this project.</p>

<h2>VEMAP2 Gridded Record</h2>
<p>The VEMAP Phase 2 historical gridded record (1895-1993) provides the most spatially comprehensive information about minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, solar radiation (and irradiance), and vapor pressure (relative humidity). The VEMAP record is based on data from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center's U.S. Historical Climate Network (HCN) and other cooperative network stations, plus the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) SnoTel stations for high elevation precipitation. Data from 8000 stations were statistically in-filled to create continuous records. These were then spatially interpolated to a 0.5 deg lat/log grid, accounting for elevation and rainshadow effects, using the PRISM model (Chris Daly, OSU and Tim Kittel, NCAR). There are both monthly and daily versions. Daily fields are generated from monthly fields using a stochastic weather generator. Grid point daily data are not spatially auto-correlated at the daily timestep (i.e. daily events are not synchronous in adjacent grid cells), but are resolved on the VEMAP 0.5ï¿½ x 0.5ï¿½ grid, a finer resolution than the GCM data. <a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/vemap/">Link</a></p>

<h2>Climate Epochs Data Set</h2>
<p>This data set, developed by NCDC, is used to identify adjacent periods with significant changes of temperature, precipitation, or both. The data set is useful for examining the effects of climate change using observed data. Periods are 10 year, 15 year, and 20 year epochs, done for each season and annual.</p>

<p>For those with a high speed Internet connection, the 2006/7 CDCD containing daily temperature, precipitation and snow-on-the-ground data is available for download. Data is available for the complete period of record for each location up to 2007. The file contains software that provides access to the data. <a href="ftp://arcdm20.tor.ec.gc.ca/pub/dist/CDCD/">CDCD Link</a>.</p>
<p>CDCD download does not appear to have accessible data. Data is in a binary format and download contains a program to read this, but provisions for bulk processing of the type we're doing do not seem to have been made.</p>
<p>Contains 7,815 locations with daily temperature, precipitation, and snow-on-the-ground data.</p>
<p>Temperatures are measured in a louvered box called a Stevenson screen, mounted 1.5 m above the ground, which is usually a level, grassy surface. At most ordinary stations the maximum temperature is the highest recorded
in a 24-hour period ending in the morning of the next day.  The minimum values are for a period of the same length, beginning in the evening of the previous day.  Mean temperature is the average of the two.  At most principal stations the maximum and minimum temperatures are for a day beginning at 0600 Greenwich (or Universal) Mean Time, which is within a few hours of midnight local standard time in Canada.</p>
<p>Rain, drizzle, freezing rain, freezing drizzle and hail are usually measured using the standard Canadian rain gauge, a cylindrical container 40 cm high and 11.3 cm in diameter.  The precipitation is funnelled into a plastic graduate which serves as the measuring device.  Snowfall is the measured depth of newly fallen snow, measured using a snow ruler.  Measurements are made at several points which appear representative of the immediate area, and then averaged.  "Precipitation" in the tables is the water equivalent of all types of precipitation.</p>

<p>At most ordinary stations the water equivalent of snowfall is computed by dividing the measured amount by ten.  At principal stations it is usually determined by melting the snow that falls into Nipher gauges.  These are precipitation gauges designed to minimize turbulence around the orifice, and to be high enough above the ground to prevent most blowing snow from entering.  The amount of snow as determined by this method normally provides a more accurate estimate of precipitation than using the "ten-to-one" rule.</p>

<p>Precipitation measurements are usually made four times daily at principal stations.  At ordinary sites they are usually made once or twice per day.</p>

<p>The CDCD data is stored in a binary format. Software incldued in the package makes it possible to view individual stations, but not to do aggregate processing. To use the software, install "dosbox" on Linux. Then mount the directories as a CD-ROM using:</p>
<pre>
mount d -t cdrom /PATH_TO_FILES
D:
CDCD.EXE
</pre>

<p>The CDCD's <i>STATION.ALL</i> file can be decoded with <a href="cdcd_all_station_decode.c">this</a> code which is based on <a href="cdcd_descriptor.doc">this</a> file descriptor sent to me in a personal communication from Caroline Barnes, Data Specialist at the Weather and Environmental Monitoring subdivision of the Meteorological Service of Canada.</p>

<p>The result of the above code can then be processed with this command: "<i>./a.out STATIONS.ALL | cut -d ',' -f 3,4,6,7 | awk -F ',' '{if($1<5028 && $2<9802 && $2>8831) print}' | cut -d ',' -f 3,4 > yearsy</i>". Which can then be processed with <a href="ranged_histogram.py">this</a> ranged histogram code to produce the following graph of data availability over time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold">Ranged Histogram of Station Availability for Manitoba/Alberta<br><img src="cdcd_manitoba.png"></p>
